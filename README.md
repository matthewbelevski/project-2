Proposal: 

Does weather affect the congestion and crowding of roads and public transport during peak hour traffic in the afternoon (4pm to 6pm)?

Data Sources:

Congestion on all roads during 2031 PM peak 2016

https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/audit-2019-congestion-on-all-roads-during-2031-pm-peak

These data represent average weekday transport performance during PM peak (4pm to 6pm). Note that any network links below relevant daily volume thresholds are not included. This is why some sections will appear missing or broken, and some links are isolated.
